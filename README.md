# Eudyptula Challenge

## Introduction

The Eudyptula Challenge was a series of programming exercises for the Linux kernel. As of 2017, there were over 19,000 people signed up to complete the challenge but less than 150 completed the challenge.

I am not an *official* participant but I'll be completing the challenge and documenting the steps that I took to complete each one.

## Development Environment

I started with a fresh Vagrant box: `vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64`
